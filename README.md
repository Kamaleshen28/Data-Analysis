# Data-Analysis
CardioGoodFitness Dataset Data Analysis. This dataset contains customer information for three treadmill models (TM195, TM498 and TM798). The goal of the study is to see if there are any differences in consumer attributes between product lines. The customer variables used in the study were the product purchased, age, gender, relationship status, average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week, average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week, fitness rate, annual income, and education of the customer.

Part1:
To uncover trends in the dataset, an exploratory data analysis is performed first. Second, we check for missing values and outliers during data preprocessing. In the procedure, outliers are removed and missing values are substituted. Following that, several attributes of the dataset are visualised in order to visually read the dataset.

Part2:
The attributes of the dataset are used to frame hypotheses. Different tests, such as the Z test, T test, and chi square test, are used to assess them. To make the analysis easier, features like the low variance filter were used to limit the amount of attributes. Finally, using the dataset, machine learning models were developed and trained.
